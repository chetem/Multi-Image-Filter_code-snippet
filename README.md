Multi-Image-Filter
=================

This is a code snippet demonstrating how to apply a filter to only a portion of an image. This is done by using a live camera video feed, but the same concept could be applied to a still image as well. Additionally, one could apply two separate filters to two different parts of the same image. In fact, why not go crazy and apply as many filters as you'd like to different parts of the same image.
